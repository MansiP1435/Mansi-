**Project Title: Data Cleaning and Analysis for Car Database**

**Short Description:**
This Python project involves reading data from an Excel file containing multiple sheets related to a car database. It performs data cleaning operations such as removing leading and trailing whitespaces from column names and cells. The cleaned data can then be further analyzed or used for various purposes.

**Getting Started:**

**Prerequisites:**
- Python installed on your system (version 3.12.2)
- pandas library installed (`pip install pandas`)

**Installing:**
1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install pandas`

**Running the Tests:**
- After installing the prerequisites, you can run the script containing the code.
- Modify the `FILEPATH` variable to point to the correct Excel file you want to read.
- Run the script. It will read the data from the Excel file, clean it, and print the first 15 rows of each dataframe.

**Breakdown of Tests:**
- The tests performed in this project include:
  1. Reading data from an Excel file.
  2. Stripping whitespace from column names.
  3. Stripping whitespace from cell values where appropriate.
  4. Printing the cleaned data for inspection.

**Deployment:**
- This project can be deployed on any system with Python installed. It can be integrated into larger data analysis pipelines or used standalone for cleaning and analyzing car database-related data.
